## Transformers and Large Language Models

> among the reasons I use large pre-trained language models sparingly in my computer-generated poetry practice is that being able to know whose voices I'm speaking with is... actually important, as is being understanding how the output came to have its shape - [@aparrish](https://twitter.com/aparrish/), [full thread](https://twitter.com/aparrish/status/1286808606466244608)

## Assignment

- Read [Language models can only write ransom notes](https://posts.decontextualize.com/language-models-ransom-notes/) by Allison Parrish and review the [The Foundation Model Transparency Index](https://crfm.stanford.edu/fmti/May-2024/index.html). What questions arise for you about using LLMs in your work at ITP?
- Experiment with prompting a large language model in some way other than a provided interface (e.g. ChatGPT) and document the results in a blog post. Consider how working with an LLM compares to generating text from the other methods including but not limited to markov chains and context free grammars. Here are some options:
  - Run [any of the code examples above](#code-examples-and-implementations) Try adjusting the prompts, interaction, or visual design.
  - Try running Llama locally with [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/). Compare and contrast different models.
