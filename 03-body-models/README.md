## Assignment 3

1. Read [Mixing movement and machine](https://medium.com/artists-and-machine-intelligence/mixing-movement-and-machine-848095ea5596) by Maya Man.
2. Read [Humans of AI](https://humans-of.ai/editorial) by Philipp Schmitt.
3. Pick one of the models above (BodyPose or BodySegmentation), following the examples above and [ml5.js documentation](https://docs.ml5js.org/), experiment with controlling elements of a p5.js sketch (color, geometry, sound, text, etc) with the output of the model.
4. Read [Open Sourcing the Origin Stories: The ml5.js Model and Data Provenance Project](https://github.com/ellennickles/ml5js-model-and-data-provenance-project) by Ellen Nickles and reflect on the the following questions:
   - What questions do you still have about the model and the associated data? Are there elements you would propose including in the biography?
   - How does understanding the provenance of the model and its data inform your creative process?
5. Document your response to the readings as well as your p5.js sketch in a blog post and add a link to the post and your p5.js sketch on the [Assignment 3 Wiki page](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-F24/wiki/Assignment-3). In your blog post, include visual documentation such as a recorded screen capture / video / GIFs of your sketch.
