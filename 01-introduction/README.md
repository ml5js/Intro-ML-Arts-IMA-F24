## Assignment 1

1. Create a blog (or a category on a blog) for the course. (You may use any means for publishing your assignments including, but not limited to, a GitHub markdown file, Notion page, medium post, etc.) [This wiki page has resources and information on creating your own blog](https://github.com/jackbdu/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-Summer24/wiki/Documentation-Blog-Resources). Additionally, here is some [helpful information on privacy options for your blog](https://www.nyu.edu/servicelink/KB0012245).
2. Read [A People’s Guide to AI](https://alliedmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/peoples-guide-ai.pdf) by Mimi Onuoha and Mother Cyborg (Diana Nucera).
3. Explore [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/index), [ImageNet sample images](https://github.com/EliSchwartz/imagenet-sample-images/blob/master/gallery.md), [Kaggle ImageNet Mini 1000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ifigotin/imagenetmini-1000). What surprises you about this data set? What questions do you have? Thinking back to last week’s assignment, can you think of any ethical considerations around how this data was collected Are there privacy considerations with the data?
4. Using the [code examples above](#code-examples), try running image classification on a variety of images. Pick at least 10 objects in your room. How many of these does it recognize? What other aspects of the image affect the classification, including but not limited to position, scale, lighting, etc.
5. Document your thoughts on MobileNet and image classification in a blog post and add a link to the [Assignment 1 Wiki page](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-F24/wiki/Assignment-1).
