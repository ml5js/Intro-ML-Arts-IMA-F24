## Assignment 5

1. Watch [Machine Learning for Human Creative Practice](https://vimeo.com/287094397) by Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink at Eyeo 2018. Write a response to the following question posed by Dr. Fiebrink:
   - How can machine learning support people's existing creative practices? Expand people's creative capabilities?
2. Create your own p5.js sketch that trains a model with real-time interactive data. This can be a prototype of a project idea or a simple exercise where you run this week's code examples with your own data. Here are some exercise suggestions:

   - Try to invent more elegant and intuitive interaction for collecting real-time data beyond pressing keys.
   - What other real-time inputs might you consider beyond mouse position, image pixels, or face/pose/hand tracking? Could you use real-time sensor data?
   - What other real-time outputs might you consider beyond text? Could the output be sound/color modulation? Could there be multiple outputs like R, G, B values? Could the output be a physical computing device?
   - Improve the the sketch we built in class:
     - Can you add more classification categories?
     - Can you create an interface for training and showing the results of model's prediction?
     - Can you turn this into a regression model?
   - Experiment with the inclusion of convolutional layers for image classification.

3. Document your response to the readings as well as your p5.js sketch in a blog post and add a link to the post and your p5.js sketch on the [Assignment 5 Wiki page](https://github.com/jackbdu/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-Summer24/wiki/Assignment-5). In your blog post, include visual documentation such as a recorded screen capture / video / GIFs of your sketch.
