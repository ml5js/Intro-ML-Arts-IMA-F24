## ml5.js project (Due October 17)

1. Watch [Machine Learning for Human Creative Practice](https://vimeo.com/287094397) by Dr. Rebecca Fiebrink at Eyeo 2018. Write a response to the following question posed by Dr. Fiebrink:

   - How can machine learning support people's existing creative practices? Expand people's creative capabilities?

2. Create a p5.js sketch with ml5.js using one or more of the models covered in this first half of the semester. Here are some ideas:

   - Use hand, body, or face keypoints to create a simple movement-controlled game. Think about how different gestures could influence the gameplay or character actions.
   - Design a musical instrument that responds to hand, body, or face keypoints, allowing gestures to control sound parameters like pitch, volume, or effects. Experiment with creating melodies or soundscapes.
   - Build an augmented mirror by overlaying drawn p5.js elements on real-time video. Use segmentation or keypoint data to add visuals that respond to the personâ€™s movements.
   - Create an interactive painting tool controlled by hand, body, or face keypoints. Explore effects like trailing particles or dynamic brushes that change shape and color based on gestures.
   - Use the output of one model as input to another. For instance, capture body or hand poses to create a custom classifier that controls an interaction. How could regression be used to modify continuous aspects, like color gradients or speed?
   - Use transfer learning with Teachable Machine to train a custom classifier on your own dataset of images. Experiment with using image classification to trigger different interactions, visuals, or sounds in your sketch.

3. Document your response to the readings as well as your p5.js sketch in a blog post and add a link to the post and your p5.js sketch on the [ml5.s Project Wiki page](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-F24/wiki/ml5.js-Project). In your blog post, include visual documentation such as a recorded screen capture / video / GIFs of your sketch.
